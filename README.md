## <u>Project Description</u>

This project collects data from an image from city-data.com and visualizes and analyzes it. 
The specific cities that were used were Gilbert, Flagstaff, and Tucson, all of which are located in Arizona. 
The data that is acquired from the image contains data on the percentage of days that are sunny, partly cloudy, fully cloudy, and rainy. 
To see more specific details about how the data is collected, downloaded, and plotted, download the jupyter notebook and read the
